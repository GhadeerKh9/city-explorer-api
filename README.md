**Project Name City explorer**

Author: Ghadeer Khasawneh Version: 1.0.0

**Overview**
This application is used to build a front end page that renders the name, address and geographical location of any city you enter in the form provided, and creating the API server as well.

**Getting Started**
The steps needed are as follows: create react app, connect it to a repo of the same name, amend this app according to what is needed, deploy the page on Netlify so anyone can see it, create a new repo on GitHub and clone it your machine, create a local host server and connect it the front end repo and deploy it to Heroku.

**Architecture**
We are using VScode text editor, JavaScript language, react app, Bootsrap, axios library to build the frontend side, and Node.js, express framework to build the backend side, GitHub, Netlify and Heroku to deploy our site.
